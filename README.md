# Stocks

This project was inspired by the final project for CS50x web development track. Instead of filling in the blanks for the Flask backend provided by the class I will be completing the project from scratch using SQLite for the user database, Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend and the IEX cloud API stock data.

## App Todo List:

- User Authentication
- Connect third party stock API
- Manipulate stock portfolio from a single page
- Dark Mode / Light Mode

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
