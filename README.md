# StoX

This project was inspired by the final project for CS50x web development track. Instead of filling in the blanks for the Flask backend and HTML frontend provided by the class I will be completing the project from scratch using PostgreSQL/CockroachDB for the user database, SvelteKit for the frontend and the IEX cloud API for stock data.

## Completed Feature List:

- User authentication with persistent log in
- Single page portfolio manipulation (Buy, Sell, Quote)
- Mobile layout
- Password reset
- Dark Mode / Light Mode

## TODO

- Guest mode for a temporary session without needing to register
- User settings (Change username, password, add cash etc.)
